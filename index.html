# Welcome 👋

I’m a **cybersecurity enthusiast** and IT student with a strong foundation in **programming**, **software development**, and **networking**. My passion lies in exploring the world of **information security**, especially areas like:

- 🐞 Malware analysis  
- 🧠 Memory forensics  
- 🌐 Web application security testing  

I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to contribute to the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity. Whether it’s hands-on labs, research, or write-ups, I’m always learning and sharing.
