Hi, I'm a **cybersecurity enthusiast** and IT student passionate about exploring the digital frontier of security.  

I enjoy learning and working on topics like:

- 🐞 Malware analysis  
- 🧠 Memory forensics  
- 🔐 Penetration testing  
- 🌐 Web application security  

This blog is where I document my journey, share knowledge, and write about what I learn.
