Hi there! I’m an IT student and cybersecurity enthusiast with a deep curiosity for how systems work—and how they can be broken, analyzed, and secured.

I’m currently exploring areas like:

### 🛡️ Security Operations Center (SOC) monitoring & threat detection 
### 🐞 Malware analysis & reverse engineering 
### 🧠 Memory and disk forensics
### 🔐 Ethical hacking & penetration testing
### 🌐 Web application security vulnerabilities

This blog is my space to share what I’m learning, reflect on challenges, and document my progress as I grow in the field. Whether it's tools, techniques, or write-ups—if I’ve learned something useful, you'll likely find it here.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to explore, connect, or just say hi on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haziq-zulkifli-010941340/)
